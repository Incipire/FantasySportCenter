#Fantasy Sport Center
Fantasy Sport Center (or FSC) is a web app built around [nfldb](http://github.com/burntsushi/nfldb).

The goal of FSC is to provide a Fantasy Football League management application that is open and available to all. Initially, the idea was to create a proprietary application, but I decided instead to make it open-source in honor of the contributions that Andrew Gallant made to fantasy football fans.

This will undoubtedly NOT be ready for managing leagues in time for NFL Kickoff 2014. But there should be enough functionality in order for you to follow your favorite players and get updates from your existing Fantasy Rosters.
